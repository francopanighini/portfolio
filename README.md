### About me 
I am very eager to both deepen my current technical knowledge and broaden my experiences in areas I may not have explored before. I am a keen teacher and passionate student who advocates for the openness of technological education to whoever craves it. 

I want to be challenged me to unknown horizons. I hope that my experience in the IT realm will help me become a better professional and a better person so that, in the future, I can help fellow students stretch their own potential.
