### About me

 I describe myself as a curious and driven person, which led me to pursue Computer Engineering. My interest in Artificial Intelligence has deepened my excitement for the future of technology and its potential to transform industries.

 As a student, I seek out new experiences with people from diverse backgrounds and am eager to expand my skill set through collaborative team projects. With a commitment to continuous learning and a growth mindset, I am always ready to embrace new opportunities for personal and professional development.
